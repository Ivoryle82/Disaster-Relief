The sandwiches are perishable but we have ways to keep them cool in the cooler bags with gel packs if we need to.  We would like for this extra food to go to the hurricane victims.  The employees would be able to bring the bags of food wherever we need to as long as it is in Manhattan.  Please contact me and let me know if this is possible to set up.  My name is **************** and my number is *************.  Thank you!\n",

We are open today and our cafeteria staff is cooking lots more food than we need today, because the food needs to be cooked.  They are making pulled pork, pulled chicken and cole slaw. It is coming from a safe school kitchen and is quite good food.  We are not sure if we will have a lot, or tons of food.  It depends on how many kids show up to school today.  I called the Red Hook Initiative about this also.  We are hoping to get this food over, assuming you can use it.  We may be able to get a teacher to drive it to you, but so far, haven't found anyone.  Might someone be able to come pick it up?  It would be available after 2:00 and probably until about 5:00.  My cell phone is *************.  Or you can call the school's main line and ask for the cafeteria.  *************.  I hope we can work this out.\n",
